# HYDRATECH INOVATIONS DESIGN AND BUILD           

# REQUIREMENTS
For this project, you must:

Use Active Record to interact with a database.
Have a minimum of two models with a one-to-many relationship.
Create API routes in Sinatra that handles at least three different CRUD actions for at least one of your Active Record models.
Build a separate React frontend application that interacts with the API to perform CRUD actions.
Use good OO design patterns. You should have separate classes for each of your models, and create instance and class methods as necessary.
For example, build a todo list application with a React frontend interface and a Sinatra backend API, where a user can:

Create a new todo
Read a list of all todos
Update an individual todo
Delete a todo
A Todo can be tagged with a Category, so that each todo belongs to a category and each category has many todos.

# GETTING STARTED
The project contains 3 tables ;
   1)Users
   2)Properties
   3)Reviews

  # Relationship
One-to-many relationship;
 One user has many properties and also has many reviews
 One property has many reviews but belongs to user
 One review belongs to both property and user

The website showcases different talents a user engages in ranging from construction, paintwork and fashion.

The user is able to upload a new post which will be stored in the server.

New user are adviced to create a new account first and verify their membership so as to get their new user_id.

A user can also update and Delete the post he/she has posted

Reviews can be posted for a given post giving your comment and ratings 

Each user_id is anonymous and can only be seen by the website owner and not other users.


# The focus of this project is building a Sinatra API backend that uses Active Record to access and persist data in a database, which will be used by a separate React frontend that interacts with the database via the API.
